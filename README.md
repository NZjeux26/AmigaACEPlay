# AmigaACEPlay

Small program learning how to use ACE to build a simple falling brick game much like my Assignment Two for 159234.

Take the folder ADF in build and put it in your DH0 or whatever hard drive you are using on your emulator and in shell navigate to the folder can call AmigAceplay.

Currently, there are two major bugs.
1. The exe will not run from a floppy/ADF. Hence why you have to copy the file for now.
2. Any score over 100,000 will not display.
