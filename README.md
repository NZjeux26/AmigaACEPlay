# AmigaACEPlay

Small program learning how to use ACE to build a simple falling brick game much like my Assignment Two for 159234.

Take the folder ADF in build and put it in your DH0 or whatever hard drive you are using on your emulator and in shell navigate to the folder that can call AmigAceplay.

Inside Build you will find an ADF file that will run on an A500 and an A1200. You can boot with the disk or run it after loading into Workbench.
